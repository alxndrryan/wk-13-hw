## The Repository

This repository holds the code for Eat-Da-Burger! application.

## Eat-Da-Burger!

This project is an application available on the user's browser. Users can click the "Devour" button next to their burger of choice to eat it. The burger is then moved to a list of previously eaten burgers. The user can add a burger of their choice by using the form and clicking "Submit."

This project gave me a better understanding of MySQL and the Express Handlebars NPM. It's given me a better understanding of how to use create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functions.
